// parameters:
// lang=xx  : only tranlates language 'xx',
//            if not given all languages are translated
// comments : generate all comments (equal to close&module)
// close    : look for similar strings that are allready translated and
//            generate a commet if a 'match' is made
// module   : generate comments that describes in which .php and/or .tpl
//            module(s) a certain string was found (useful for checking
//            translations in context)
// patch    : looks for the file 'language.patch' in the same directory
//            as the corresponding language.php and overrides any strings
//            in language.php - good if a user does not agree with
//            some translations or if only changes are sent to the maintaner
// Examples:
// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv
// Will translate langauage 'sv' and (almost) avoiding comment generation

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&comments
// Will translate langauage 'sv' and generate all possible comments.
// This is the most usefull mode when working on a translation.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&nohelp&nosections
// These options will only provide the minimal amout of comments.
// Usefull mode when preparing a translation for distribution.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?nohelp&nosections
// Prepare all languages for release
